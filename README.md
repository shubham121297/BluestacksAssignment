## Older url is dead .I have updated the apk of the app just now at 00:14 IST.

Did not upload some of the build files.

## Getting Started

I have created two screens 
(i)login screen
(ii)user details screen
In login screen i applied everything asked.
Also in User details screen i did all.I also made my own rest api and converted my local host url into publicurl which i hit for section above "recommended for you" .I used "ngrok" website for this.I created 2 users as asked and credentials are:->
Clutchgawd/12345
Flyinghawk/1234
I created the rest api using express and my data came from a users.json file which i hardcoded for 2 users.
I have uploaded the api code too.
I also tried to add logout functionality(it wasn't asked though) so that every time one opens it do not have to delete its app data and login again.But i was not able to implement that ,given more time i could have done that.I have commented some tries codes though.
I was not able to apply localizations as building the app and releasing it took my whole day today.
Also i used local stateful widgets to maintain state and also used provides for app-wide states.I could have used consumers though but it was not required.
Thank you.Felt great after making this short little app named "UserDetails".
NOTE:I really dont know how long that ngrok will run my public url.I did not upload node_modules folder in api.
